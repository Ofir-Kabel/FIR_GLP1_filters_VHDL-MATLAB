# FIR_GLP1_filters_VHDL-MATLAB

imlementing a FIR GLP1 filters on matlab using the LPF as a tool to make HP,SP.BP filters.
after that converting the filters coefficiants to VHDL platform and tb the FIR component with input signal from 3 frequencies 
so we can see how is the output affected from the filter.

the filter process is taken from www.vhdlwhiz.com which help a lot to understand how to implement the convolution func and how to use only DSP slices.
the filter design as I learned in DSP laboratory course in my univercity.
